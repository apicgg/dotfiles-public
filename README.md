# Anurag's Dotfiles

My personal development environment configuration.

## What's Included

- **Neovim** - LazyVim-based setup with custom plugins
- **Tmux** - Session management with plugins (resurrect, continuum, custom solarized theme)
- **Zsh** - Shell configuration
- **Git** - Global git configuration and ignore rules
- **VS Code** - Editor settings and keybindings

## Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone and symlink configs
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles-public.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles

# Symlink individual configs as needed or use stow to manage
```

**Note**: Use at your own risk. These are my personal preferences.
